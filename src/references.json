We used that issue to investigate the effectiveness of this badge, focusing on the adherence to its aim at Psychological Science: sharing both data and code to ensure reproducibility of results. Twelve researchers of varying experience levels attempted to reproduce the results of the empirical articles in the target issue (at least three researchers per article). We found that all 14 articles provided at least some data and six provided analysis code, but only one article was rated to be exactly reproducible, and three were rated as essentially reproducible with minor deviations. We suggest that researchers should be encouraged to adhere to the higher standard in force at Psychological Science. Moreover, a check of reproducibility during peer review may be preferable to the disclosure method of awarding badges.

Here we examine issues within Frequentist statistics that may have led to the replication crisis, and we examine the alternative—Bayesian statistics—that many have suggested as a replacement. The Frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach offer radically different perspectives on evidence and inference with the Frequentist approach prioritising error control and the Bayesian approach offering a formal method for quantifying the relative strength of evidence for hypotheses. We suggest that rather than mere statistical reform, what is needed is a better understanding of the different modes of statistical inference and a better understanding of how statistical inference relates to scientific inference.

Methods From a large sample (N = 1,303) of typically developing children, we selected a group definable as having MLD. The children were given measures of basic number processing and domain-general constructs. Differences between the observed sample and a simulated population were estimated using Cohen’s d and Bayes factors. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve was computed to ascertain the diagnostic power of measures. Results Results suggest that the differences between the MLD and control group can be defined along with general characteristics of the population rather than assuming single or multiple ‘core deficits’. None of the measures of interest exceeded the diagnostic power that could be derived via simulation from the dimensional characteristics of the general population. Conclusions There is no evidence for core deficit(s) in MLD. We suggest that future research should focus on representative samples of typical populations and on carefully tested clinical samples confirming to the criteria of international diagnostic manuals. Clinical diagnoses require that MLD is persistent and resistant to intervention, so studies would deliver results less exposed to measurement fluctuations. Uniform diagnostic criteria would also allow for the easy cross-study comparison of samples overcoming a serious limitation of the current literature.","preprint":"https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.13397"},{"title":"Registered Replication Report on Fischer, Castel, Dodd, and Pratt (2003)","journal":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","year":2020,"doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2515245920903079","authors":"Colling, Szűcs, Marco, Cipora, Ulrich, Nuerk, Soltanlou, Bryce, Chen, Schroeder, Henare, Chrystall, Corballis, Ansari, Goffin, Sokolowski, Hancock, Millen, Langton, Holmes, Saviano, Tummino, Lindemann, Zwaan, Lukavský, Becková, Vranka, Cutini, Mammarella, Mulatti, Bell, Buchner, Mieth, Röer, Klein, Huber, Moeller, Ocampo, Lupiáñez, Ortiz-Tudela, Fuente, Santiago, Ouellet, Hubbard, Toomarian, Job, Treccani, McShane","reference":"Colling, L.

On account of action prediction suggests that mechanisms are grounded in the motor control system and carry traces of an actor's motor experience and biomechanics. If this is true, then it may be the case that, if certain people are better matched in terms of biomechanics or other anthropometric factors, then this might have an influence on how accurately they can predict or align with each other.

Children with developmental dyslexia show impairments in beat synchronization. These impairments may reflect deficiencies in auditory perception of the beat which in turn affect auditory-motor mapping, or may reflect an independent motor deficit. Here, we used a new methodology in EEG based on measuring beat-related steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EPs, Nozaradan et al., 2015) in an attempt to disentangle neural sensory and motor contributions to behavioral beat synchronization in children with dyslexia. Children tapped with both their left and right hands to every second beat of a metronome pulse delivered at 2.4 Hz, or listened passively to the beat. Analyses of preferred phase in EEG showed that the children with dyslexia had a significantly different preferred phase compared to control children in all conditions. Regarding SS-EPs, the groups differed significantly for the passive Auditory listening condition at 2.4 Hz, and showed a trend toward a difference in the Right hand tapping condition at 3.6 Hz (sensorimotor integration measure). The data suggest that neural rhythmic entrainment is atypical in children with dyslexia for both an auditory beat and during sensorimotor coupling (tapping). The data are relevant to a growing literature suggesting that rhythm-based interventions may help language processing in children with developmental disorders of language learning."},{"title":"Neural encoding of the speech envelope by children with developmental dyslexia","journal":"Brain and Language","year":2016,"doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2016.06.006","authors":"Power, Colling, Mead, Barnes, Goswami","reference":"Power, A.

We assess the neural quality of speech encoding in children with dyslexia by measuring the accuracy of low-frequency speech envelope encoding using EEG. We tested children with dyslexia and chronological age-matched (CA) and reading-level matched (RL) younger children. Participants listened to semantically-unpredictable sentences in a word report task. The sentences were noise-vocoded to increase reliance on envelope cues. Envelope reconstruction for envelopes between 0 and 10 Hz showed that the children with dyslexia had significantly poorer speech encoding in the 0–2 Hz band compared to both CA and RL controls. These data suggest that impaired neural encoding of low frequency speech envelopes, related to speech prosody, may underpin the phonological deficit that causes dyslexia across languages."},{"title":"Awareness of rhythm patterns in speech and music in children with specific language impairments","journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","year":2015,"doi":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00672","authors":"Cumming, Wilson, Leong, Colling, Goswami","reference":"Cumming, R., Wilson, A., Leong, V., Colling, L.

Here we explore potential links between language development and rhythm perception in 45 children with SLI and 50 age-matched controls. We administered three rhythmic tasks, a musical beat detection task, a tapping-to-music task, and a novel music/speech task, which varied rhythm and pitch cues independently or together in both speech and music. Via low-pass filtering, the music sounded as though it was played from a low-quality radio and the speech sounded as though it was muffled (heard “behind the door”). We report data for all of the SLI children (N = 45, IQ varying), as well as for two independent subgroupings with intact IQ. One subgroup, “Pure SLI,” had intact phonology and reading (N = 16), the other, “SLI PPR” (N = 15), had impaired phonology and reading. When IQ varied (all SLI children), we found significant group differences in all the rhythmic tasks. For the Pure SLI group, there were rhythmic impairments in the tapping task only. For children with SLI and poor phonology (SLI PPR), group differences were found in all of the filtered speech/music AXB tasks. We conclude that difficulties with rhythmic cues in both speech and music are present in children with SLIs, but that some rhythmic measures are more sensitive than others. The data are interpreted within a “prosodic phrasing” hypothesis, and we discuss the potential utility of rhythmic and musical interventions in remediating speech and language difficulties in children.

Within the literature that seeks to explain how this action alignment is possible, two broad approaches have appeared. The first, what we term the entrainment approach, has sought to explain these alignment phenomena in terms of the behavioral dynamics of the system of two agents. The second, what we term the emulator approach, has sought to explain these alignment phenomena in terms of mechanisms, such as forward and inverse models, that are implemented in the brain. They have often been pitched as alternative explanations of the same phenomena; however, we argue that this view is mistaken, because, as we show, these two approaches are engaged in distinct, and not mutually exclusive, explanatory tasks. While the entrainment approach seeks to uncover the general laws that govern behavior the emulator approach seeks to uncover mechanisms. We argue that is possible to do both and that the entrainment approach must pay greater attention to the mechanisms that support the behavioral dynamics of interest. In short, the entrainment approach must be transformed into a neuroentrainment approach by adopting a mechanistic view of explanation and by seeking mechanisms that are implemented in the brain.

Recent theory suggests that action prediction relies on an emulator system that permits observers to use a model of their own movement kinematics to predict the actions of other agents. If this is the case, then people should be more accurate at generating predictions about actions that are similar to their own. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments in which participants were required to predict the occurrence and timing of particular critical points in an observed action. In Experiment 1, we employed a self/other prediction paradigm in which prediction accuracy for recordings of self-generated movements was compared with prediction accuracy for recordings of other-generated movements. As expected, prediction was more accurate for recordings of self-generated actions because in this case the movement kinematics of the observer and observed stimuli are maximally similar. In Experiment 1, people were able to produce actions at their own tempo and, therefore, the results might be explained in terms of self-similarity in action production tempo rather than in terms of movement kinematics. To control for this possibility in Experiment 2, we compared prediction accuracy for stimuli that were matched in tempo but differed only in terms of kinematics. The results showed that participants were more accurate when predicting actions with a human kinematic profile than tempo-matched stimuli that moved with non-human kinematics. Finally, in Experiment 3, we confirmed that the results of Experiment 2 cannot be explained by human-like stimuli containing a slowing down phase before the critical points. Taken together, these findings provide further support for the role of motor emulation in action prediction, and they suggest that the action prediction mechanism produces output that is available rapidly and available to drive action control suggesting that it can plausibly support joint action coordination.

They argue that direct, unmediated emotional responses to music can be explained by viewing music listening as an embodied experience that engages sensory-motor processes. First, they illustrate the multi-modal nature of music by reviewing evidence that shows that merely observing the actions that accompany music performance greatly influences our perception and interpretation of the acoustic dimension of music. Second, they introduce a theoretical framework that views perception and action as inextricably linked, and that construes music as a unique type of multi-modal behavior specialized for engaging predictive, sensory-motor processes in listeners. Finally, they demonstrate that this framework allows for a unification of expectancy-based models of musical emotion and action-based models of emotional experience."},{"title":"Motor experience interacts with effector information during action prediction","journal":"Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society","year":2013,"doi":"https://cogsci.mindmodeling.org/2013/papers/papers/0383/paper0383.pdf","authors":"Colling, Thompson, Sutton","reference":"Colling, L.

According to these theories, perception and action share a common representational code, with actions coded in terms of the distal perceptual effects that they produce (Prinz, 1997). Accordingly, action representations should be activated when perceiving actions or perceiving the perceptual effects generated by actions. Mirror neurons have been regarded as a neural substrate implementing this functional principle. Perhaps the most important implication of common coding is that it establishes a social link between actor and observer that supports action understanding (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010) and/or prediction (Wilson and Knoblich, 2005). How might close perception–action links help people to perform actions together? In the sections that follow, we discuss three possible functions of mirroring for joint action: 1) supporting temporal coordination in real time, 2) enabling seamless integration of one's own and others' actions in joint action planning, and 3) enabling groups to imitate the coordinated actions of other groups.
