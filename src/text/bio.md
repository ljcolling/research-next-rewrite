### Bio

I'm currently a machine learning engineer at a startup building AI-powered
data-analytics solutions. Prior to this, I was a university lecturer and
researcher in cognitive science and applied statistics.

I hold a PhD in Cognitive Science from [Macquarie University](https://mq.edu.au)
in Sydney, and I have held academic positions at the [University of
Sussex](https://sussex.ac.uk), the [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk), and the [Donders
Institute for Brain, Behaviour, and Cognition](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) at
Radboud University (Nijmegen, Netherlands).

I completed my PhD, titled Predicting the Actions of Other Agents, in 2012 in
the Department of Cognitive Science at Macquarie University, where I was
affiliated with the Collective Cognition Research Group, the Perception and
Action Research Centre, and the Music, Sound, and Performance Laboratory.

Iâ€™m a cognitive scientist based at the [University of
Sussex](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p488921-lincoln-colling). My work spans
neuroscience, experimental psychology, and philosophy and I try to investigate
problems at multiple levels and from multiple perspectives.

Before the University of Sussex, I held research positions at the [University of
Cambridge](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/), the [ARC Centre of
Excellence in Cognition and Its
Disorders](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/our-faculties/medicine-and-health-sciences/departments-and-centres/department-of-cognitive-science/alumni)
at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia), and the I also held a lectureship in the School of
Psychology at the Australian Catholic University (Brisbane, Australia).  

I completed my PhD, titled Predicting the Actions of Other Agents, in 2012 in
